 * <h3>Developer Guide</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The ability to search for user, system, or network based data is considered to be
 * a core user-level feature of the Android platform.  At any time, the user should be
 * able to use a familiar command, button, or keystroke to invoke search, and the user
 * should be able to search any data which is available to them.
 * 
 * <p>To make search appear to the user as a seamless system-wide feature, the application
 * framework centrally controls it, offering APIs to individual applications to control how they
 * are searched. Applications can customize how search is invoked, how the search dialog looks,
 * and what type of search results are available, including suggestions that are available as the
 * user types.
 *
 * <p>Even applications which are not searchable will by default support the invocation of
 * search to trigger Quick Search Box, the system's 'global search'.
 * 
 * <a name="HowSearchIsInvoked"></a>
 * <h3>How Search Is Invoked</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Unless impossible or inapplicable, all applications should support
 * invoking the search UI.  This means that when the user invokes the search command, 
 * a search UI will be presented to them.  The search command is currently defined as a menu
 * item called "Search" (with an alphabetic shortcut key of "S"), or on many devices, a dedicated
 * search button key.
 * <p>If your application is not inherently searchable, the default implementation will cause
 * the search UI to be invoked in a "global search" mode known as Quick Search Box.  As the user
 * types, search suggestions from across the device and the web will be surfaced, and if they
 * click the "Search" button, this will bring the browser to the front and will launch a web-based
 * search.  The user will be able to click the "Back" button and return to your application.
 * <p>In general this is implemented by your activity, or the {@link android.app.Activity Activity}
 * base class, which captures the search command and invokes the SearchManager to 
 * display and operate the search UI.  You can also cause the search UI to be presented in response
 * to user keystrokes in your activity (for example, to instantly start filter searching while
 * viewing a list and typing any key).
 * <p>The search UI is presented as a floating 
 * window and does not cause any change in the activity stack.  If the user 
 * cancels search, the previous activity re-emerges.  If the user launches a 
 * search, this will be done by sending a search {@link android.content.Intent Intent} (see below), 
 * and the normal intent-handling sequence will take place (your activity will pause,
 * etc.)
 * <p><b>What you need to do:</b> First, you should consider the way in which you want to
 * handle invoking search.  There are four broad (and partially overlapping) categories for 
 * you to choose from.
 * <ul><li>You can capture the search command yourself, by including a <i>search</i>
 * button or menu item - and invoking the search UI directly.</li>
 * <li>You can provide a <i>type-to-search</i> feature, in which search is invoked automatically
 * when the user enters any characters.</li>
 * <li>Even if your application is not inherently searchable, you can allow global search, 
 * via the search key (or even via a search menu item).
 * <li>You can disable search entirely.  This should only be used in very rare circumstances,
 * as search is a system-wide feature and users will expect it to be available in all contexts.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>How to define a search menu.</b>  The system provides the following resources which may
 * be useful when adding a search item to your menu:
 * <ul><li>android.R.drawable.ic_search_category_default is an icon you can use in your menu.</li>
 * <li>{@link #MENU_KEY SearchManager.MENU_KEY} is the recommended alphabetic shortcut.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>How to invoke search directly.</b>  In order to invoke search directly, from a button
 * or menu item, you can launch a generic search by calling
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onSearchRequested onSearchRequested} as shown:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * onSearchRequested();</pre>
 * 
 * <p><b>How to implement type-to-search.</b>  While setting up your activity, call
 * {@link android.app.Activity#setDefaultKeyMode setDefaultKeyMode}:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * setDefaultKeyMode(DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_LOCAL);   // search within your activity
 * setDefaultKeyMode(DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_GLOBAL);  // search using platform global search</pre>
 * 
 * <p><b>How to enable global search with Quick Search Box.</b>  In addition to searching within
 * your activity or application, you can also use the Search Manager to invoke a platform-global
 * search, which uses Quick Search Box to search across the device and the web. There are two ways
 * to do this:
 * <ul><li>You can simply define "search" within your application or activity to mean global search.
 * This is described in more detail in the 
 * <a href="#SearchabilityMetadata">Searchability Metadata</a> section.  Briefly, you will
 * add a single meta-data entry to your manifest, declaring that the default search
 * for your application is "*".  This indicates to the system that no application-specific
 * search activity is provided, and that it should launch web-based search instead.</li>
 * <li>Simply do nothing and the default implementation of
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onSearchRequested} will cause global search to be triggered.
 * (You can also always trigger search via a direct call to {@link android.app.Activity#startSearch}.
 * This is most useful if you wish to provide local searchability <i>and</i> access to global
 * search.)</li></ul> 
 * 
 * <p><b>How to disable search from your activity.</b> Search is a system-wide feature and users
 * will expect it to be available in all contexts.  If your UI design absolutely precludes
 * launching search, override {@link android.app.Activity#onSearchRequested onSearchRequested}
 * as shown:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &#64;Override
 * public boolean onSearchRequested() {
 *    return false;
 * }</pre> 
 * 
 * <p><b>Managing focus and knowing if search is active.</b>  The search UI is not a separate
 * activity, and when the UI is invoked or dismissed, your activity will not typically be paused,
 * resumed, or otherwise notified by the methods defined in 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html#actlife">Application Fundamentals: 
 * Activity Lifecycle</a>.  The search UI is
 * handled in the same way as other system UI elements which may appear from time to time, such as 
 * notifications, screen locks, or other system alerts:  
 * <p>When the search UI appears, your activity will lose input focus.
 * <p>When the search activity is dismissed, there are three possible outcomes:
 * <ul><li>If the user simply canceled the search UI, your activity will regain input focus and
 * proceed as before.  See {@link #setOnDismissListener} and {@link #setOnCancelListener} if you 
 * required direct notification of search dialog dismissals.</li>
 * <li>If the user launched a search, and this required switching to another activity to receive
 * and process the search {@link android.content.Intent Intent}, your activity will receive the 
 * normal sequence of activity pause or stop notifications.</li>
 * <li>If the user launched a search, and the current activity is the recipient of the search 
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent}, you will receive notification via the 
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent onNewIntent()} method.</li></ul>
 * <p>This list is provided in order to clarify the ways in which your activities will interact with
 * the search UI.  More details on searchable activities and search intents are provided in the
 * sections below.
 *
 * <a name="ImplementingSearchForYourApp"></a>
 * <h3>Implementing Search for Your App</h3>
 *
 * <p>The following steps are necessary in order to implement search.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement search invocation as described above.  (Strictly speaking, 
 * these are decoupled, but it would make little sense to be "searchable" but not 
 * "search-invoking".)</li>
 * <li>Your application should have an activity that takes a search string and
 * converts it to a list of results.  This could be your primary display activity
 * or it could be a dedicated search results activity.  This is your <i>searchable</i>
 * activity and every query-search application must have one.</li>
 * <li>In the searchable activity, in onCreate(), you must receive and handle the 
 * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH}
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent}.  The text to search (query string) for is provided by 
 * calling 
 * {@link #QUERY getStringExtra(SearchManager.QUERY)}.</li>
 * <li>To identify and support your searchable activity, you'll need to 
 * provide an XML file providing searchability configuration parameters, a reference to that 
 * in your searchable activity's
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a> entry, and an
 * intent-filter declaring that you can receive ACTION_SEARCH intents. This is described in more
 * detail in the <a href="#SearchabilityMetadata">Searchability Metadata</a> section.</li>
 * <li>Your <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a> also needs a
 * metadata entry providing a global reference to the searchable activity. This is the "glue"
 * directing the search UI, when invoked from any of your <i>other</i> activities, to use your
 * application as the default search context.  This is also described in more detail in the 
 * <a href="#SearchabilityMetadata">Searchability Metadata</a> section.</li> 
 * <li>Finally, you may want to define your search results activity as single-top with the 
 * {@link android.R.attr#launchMode singleTop} launchMode flag.  This allows the system 
 * to launch searches from/to the same activity without creating a pile of them on the 
 * activity stack.  If you do this, be sure to also override 
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent onNewIntent} to handle the
 * updated intents (with new queries) as they arrive.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Code snippet showing handling of intents in your search activity:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &#64;Override
 * protected void onCreate(Bundle icicle) {
 *     super.onCreate(icicle);
 *     
 *     final Intent queryIntent = getIntent();
 *     final String queryAction = queryIntent.getAction();
 *     if (Intent.ACTION_SEARCH.equals(queryAction)) {
 *         doSearchWithIntent(queryIntent);
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * private void doSearchWithIntent(final Intent queryIntent) {
 *     final String queryString = queryIntent.getStringExtra(SearchManager.QUERY);
 *     doSearchWithQuery(queryString);
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <a name="Suggestions"></a>
 * <h3>Search Suggestions</h3>
 * 
 * <p>A powerful feature of the search system is the ability of any application to easily provide
 * live "suggestions" in order to prompt the user.  Each application implements suggestions in a 
 * different, unique, and appropriate way.  Suggestions be drawn from many sources, including but 
 * not limited to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Actual searchable results (e.g. names in the address book)</li>
 * <li>Recently entered queries</li>
 * <li>Recently viewed data or results</li>
 * <li>Contextually appropriate queries or results</li>
 * <li>Summaries of possible results</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Once an application is configured to provide search suggestions, those same suggestions can
 * easily be made available to the system-wide Quick Search Box, providing faster access to its
 * content from one central prominent place. See
 * <a href="#ExposingSearchSuggestionsToQuickSearchBox">Exposing Search Suggestions to Quick Search
 * Box</a> for more details.
 * 
 * <p>The primary form of suggestions is known as <i>queried suggestions</i> and is based on query
 * text that the user has already typed.  This would generally be based on partial matches in
 * the available data.  In certain situations - for example, when no query text has been typed yet -
 * an application may also opt to provide <i>zero-query suggestions</i>.
 * These would typically be drawn from the same data source, but because no partial query text is 
 * available, they should be weighted based on other factors - for example, most recent queries 
 * or most recent results.
 * 
 * <p><b>Overview of how suggestions are provided.</b>  Suggestions are accessed via a
 * {@link android.content.ContentProvider Content Provider}. When the search manager identifies a 
 * particular activity as searchable, it will check for certain metadata which indicates that
 * there is also a source of suggestions.  If suggestions are provided, the following steps are
 * taken.
 * <ul><li>Using formatting information found in the metadata, the user's query text (whatever
 * has been typed so far) will be formatted into a query and sent to the suggestions 
 * {@link android.content.ContentProvider Content Provider}.</li>
 * <li>The suggestions {@link android.content.ContentProvider Content Provider} will create a
 * {@link android.database.Cursor Cursor} which can iterate over the possible suggestions.</li>
 * <li>The search manager will populate a list using display data found in each row of the cursor,
 * and display these suggestions to the user.</li>
 * <li>If the user types another key, or changes the query in any way, the above steps are repeated
 * and the suggestions list is updated or repopulated.</li>
 * <li>If the user clicks or touches the "GO" button, the suggestions are ignored and the search is
 * launched using the normal {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} type of 
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent}.</li>
 * <li>If the user uses the directional controls to navigate the focus into the suggestions list,
 * the query text will be updated while the user navigates from suggestion to suggestion.  The user
 * can then click or touch the updated query and edit it further.  If the user navigates back to
 * the edit field, the original typed query is restored.</li>
 * <li>If the user clicks or touches a particular suggestion, then a combination of data from the 
 * cursor and
 * values found in the metadata are used to synthesize an Intent and send it to the application.
 * Depending on the design of the activity and the way it implements search, this might be a
 * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} (in order to launch a query), or it
 * might be a {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_VIEW ACTION_VIEW}, in order to proceed directly
 * to display of specific data.</li>
 * </ul>
 *  
 * <p><b>Simple Recent-Query-Based Suggestions.</b>  The Android framework provides a simple Search
 * Suggestions provider, which simply records and replays recent queries.  For many applications,
 * this will be sufficient.  The basic steps you will need to
 * do, in order to use the built-in recent queries suggestions provider, are as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement and test query search, as described in the previous sections.</li>
 * <li>Create a Provider within your application by extending 
 * {@link android.content.SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider}.</li>
 * <li>Create a manifest entry describing your provider.</li>
 * <li>Update your searchable activity's XML configuration file with information about your
 * provider.</li>
 * <li>In your searchable activities, capture any user-generated queries and record them
 * for future searches by calling {@link android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions#saveRecentQuery}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>For complete implementation details, please refer to 
 * {@link android.content.SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider}.  The rest of the information in this
 * section should not be necessary, as it refers to custom suggestions providers.
 * 
 * <p><b>Creating a Customized Suggestions Provider:</b>  In order to create more sophisticated
 * suggestion providers, you'll need to take the following steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement and test query search, as described in the previous sections.</li>
 * <li>Decide how you wish to <i>receive</i> suggestions.  Just like queries that the user enters,
 * suggestions will be delivered to your searchable activity as 
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent} messages;  Unlike simple queries, you have quite a bit of
 * flexibility in forming those intents.  A query search application will probably
 * wish to continue receiving the {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} 
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent}, which will launch a query search using query text as
 * provided by the suggestion.  A filter search application will probably wish to 
 * receive the {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_VIEW ACTION_VIEW} 
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent}, which will take the user directly to a selected entry.
 * Other interesting suggestions, including hybrids, are possible, and the suggestion provider
 * can easily mix-and-match results to provide a richer set of suggestions for the user.  Finally,
 * you'll need to update your searchable activity (or other activities) to receive the intents
 * as you've defined them.</li>
 * <li>Implement a Content Provider that provides suggestions.  If you already have one, and it 
 * has access to your suggestions data, you can use that provider. If not, you'll have to create 
 * one. You'll also provide information about your Content Provider in your 
 * package's <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a>.</li>
 * <li>Update your searchable activity's XML configuration file.  There are two categories of
 * information used for suggestions:
 * <ul><li>The first is (required) data that the search manager will
 * use to format the queries which are sent to the Content Provider.</li>
 * <li>The second is (optional) parameters to configure structure
 * if intents generated by suggestions.</li></li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Configuring your Content Provider to Receive Suggestion Queries.</b>  The basic job of
 * a search suggestions {@link android.content.ContentProvider Content Provider} is to provide
 * "live" (while-you-type) conversion of the user's query text into a set of zero or more 
 * suggestions.  Each application is free to define the conversion, and as described above there are
 * many possible solutions.  This section simply defines how to communicate with the suggestion
 * provider.  
 * 
 * <p>The Search Manager must first determine if your package provides suggestions.  This is done
 * by examination of your searchable meta-data XML file.  The android:searchSuggestAuthority
 * attribute, if provided, is the signal to obtain & display suggestions.
 * 
 * <p>Every query includes a Uri, and the Search Manager will format the Uri as shown:
 * <p><pre class="prettyprint">
 * content:// your.suggest.authority / your.suggest.path / SearchManager.SUGGEST_URI_PATH_QUERY</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Your Content Provider can receive the query text in one of two ways.
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Query provided as a selection argument.</b>  If you define the attribute value
 * android:searchSuggestSelection and include a string, this string will be passed as the 
 * <i>selection</i> parameter to your Content Provider's query function.  You must define a single
 * selection argument, using the '?' character.  The user's query text will be passed to you
 * as the first element of the selection arguments array.</li>
 * <li><b>Query provided with Data Uri.</b>  If you <i>do not</i> define the attribute value
 * android:searchSuggestSelection, then the Search Manager will append another "/" followed by
 * the user's query to the query Uri.  The query will be encoding using Uri encoding rules - don't
 * forget to decode it.  (See {@link android.net.Uri#getPathSegments} and
 * {@link android.net.Uri#getLastPathSegment} for helpful utilities you can use here.)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Providing access to Content Providers that require permissions.</b>  If your content
 * provider declares an android:readPermission in your application's manifest, you must provide
 * access to the search infrastructure to the search suggestion path by including a path-permission
 * that grants android:readPermission access to "android.permission.GLOBAL_SEARCH".  Granting access
 * explicitly to the search infrastructure ensures it will be able to access the search suggestions
 * without needing to know ahead of time any other details of the permissions protecting your
 * provider.  Content providers that require no permissions are already available to the search
 * infrastructure.  Here is an example of a provider that protects access to it with permissions,
 * and provides read access to the search infrastructure to the path that it expects to receive the
 * suggestion query on:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &lt;provider android:name="MyProvider" android:authorities="myprovider"
 *        android:readPermission="android.permission.READ_MY_DATA"
 *        android:writePermission="android.permission.WRITE_MY_DATA"&gt;
 *    &lt;path-permission android:path="/search_suggest_query"
 *            android:readPermission="android.permission.GLOBAL_SEARCH" /&gt;
 * &lt;/provider&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Handling empty queries.</b>  Your application should handle the "empty query"
 * (no user text entered) case properly, and generate useful suggestions in this case.  There are a
 * number of ways to do this;  Two are outlined here:
 * <ul><li>For a simple filter search of local data, you could simply present the entire dataset,
 * unfiltered.  (example: People)</li>
 * <li>For a query search, you could simply present the most recent queries.  This allows the user
 * to quickly repeat a recent search.</li></ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The Format of Individual Suggestions.</b>  Your suggestions are communicated back to the
 * Search Manager by way of a {@link android.database.Cursor Cursor}.  The Search Manager will
 * usually pass a null Projection, which means that your provider can simply return all appropriate
 * columns for each suggestion.  The columns currently defined are:
 * 
 * <table border="2" width="85%" align="center" frame="hsides" rules="rows">
 *
 *     <thead>
 *     <tr><th>Column Name</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Required?</th></tr>
 *     </thead>
 *
 *     <tbody>
 *     <tr><th>{@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_FORMAT}</th>
 *         <td><i>Unused - can be null.</i></td>
 *         <td align="center">No</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     
 *     <tr><th>{@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1}</th>
 *         <td>This is the line of text that will be presented to the user as the suggestion.</td>
 *         <td align="center">Yes</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     
 *     <tr><th>{@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_2}</th>
 *         <td>If your cursor includes this column, then all suggestions will be provided in a 
 *             two-line format.  The data in this column will be displayed as a second, smaller
 *             line of text below the primary suggestion, or it can be null or empty to indicate no
 *             text in this row's suggestion.</td>
 *         <td align="center">No</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     
 *     <tr><th>{@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_ICON_1}</th>
 *         <td>If your cursor includes this column, then all suggestions will be provided in an
 *             icons+text format.  This value should be a reference to the icon to
 *             draw on the left side, or it can be null or zero to indicate no icon in this row.
 *             </td>
 *         <td align="center">No.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *

 *             </td>
 *         <td align="center">No.</td>

 *             field in your XML metadata.  <i>At least one of these must be present for the 
 *             suggestion to generate an intent.</i>  Note:  If your action is the same for all

 *
 * <p>Clearly there are quite a few permutations of your suggestion data, but in the next section
 * we'll look at a few simple combinations that you'll select from. 
 *
 * <p><b>The Format Of Intents Sent By Search Suggestions.</b>  Although there are many ways to 
 * configure these intents, this document will provide specific information on just a few of them.  
 * <ul><li><b>Launch a query.</b>  In this model, each suggestion represents a query that your
 * searchable activity can perform, and the {@link android.content.Intent Intent} will be formatted
 * exactly like those sent when the user enters query text and clicks the "GO" button:
 *   <ul>
 *   <li><b>Action:</b> {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} provided
 *   using your XML metadata (android:searchSuggestIntentAction).</li>
 *   <li><b>Data:</b> empty (not used).</li>
 *   <li><b>Query:</b> query text supplied by the cursor.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Go directly to a result, using a complete Data Uri.</b>  In this model, the user will be 
 * taken directly to a specific result.
 *   <ul>
 *   <li><b>Action:</b> {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_VIEW ACTION_VIEW}</li>
 *   <li><b>Data:</b> a complete Uri, supplied by the cursor, that identifies the desired data.</li>
 *   <li><b>Query:</b> query text supplied with the suggestion (probably ignored)</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Go directly to a result, using a synthesized Data Uri.</b>  This has the same result
 * as the previous suggestion, but provides the Data Uri in a different way.
 *   <ul>
 *   <li><b>Action:</b> {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_VIEW ACTION_VIEW}</li>
 *   <li><b>Data:</b> The search manager will assemble a Data Uri using the following elements:  
 *   a Uri fragment provided in your XML metadata (android:searchSuggestIntentData), followed by 
 *   a single "/", followed by the value found in the {@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID} 
 *   entry in your cursor.</li>
 *   <li><b>Query:</b> query text supplied with the suggestion (probably ignored)</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>This list is not meant to be exhaustive.  Applications should feel free to define other types
 * of suggestions.  For example, you could reduce long lists of results to summaries, and use one
 * of the above intents (or one of your own) with specially formatted Data Uri's to display more
 * detailed results.  Or you could display textual shortcuts as suggestions, but launch a display
 * in a more data-appropriate format such as media artwork.
 * 
 * <p><b>Suggestion Rewriting.</b>  If the user navigates through the suggestions list, the UI
 * may temporarily rewrite the user's query with a query that matches the currently selected 
 * suggestion.  This enables the user to see what query is being suggested, and also allows the user
 * to click or touch in the entry EditText element and make further edits to the query before
 * dispatching it.  In order to perform this correctly, the Search UI needs to know exactly what
 * text to rewrite the query with.
 * 
 * <p>For each suggestion, the following logic is used to select a new query string:
 * <ul><li>If the suggestion provides an explicit value in the {@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_QUERY} 
 * column, this value will be used.</li>
 * <li>If the metadata includes the queryRewriteFromData flag, and the suggestion provides an 
 * explicit value for the intent Data field, this Uri will be used.  Note that this should only be
 * used with Uri's that are intended to be user-visible, such as HTTP.  Internal Uri schemes should
 * not be used in this way.</li>
 * <li>If the metadata includes the queryRewriteFromText flag, the text in 
 * {@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1} will be used.  This should be used for suggestions in which no
 * query text is provided and the SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA values are not suitable for user 
 * inspection and editing.</li></ul>
 *
 * <a name="ExposingSearchSuggestionsToQuickSearchBox"></a>
 * <h3>Exposing Search Suggestions to Quick Search Box</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Once your application is set up to provide search suggestions, making them available to the
 * globally accessable Quick Search Box is as easy as setting android:includeInGlobalSearch to
 * "true" in your searchable metadata file.  Beyond that, here are some more details of how
 * suggestions interact with Quick Search Box, and optional ways that you may customize suggestions
 * for your application.
 * 
 * <p><b>Important Note:</b>  By default, your application will not be enabled as a suggestion
 * provider (or "searchable item") in Quick Search Box. Once your app is installed, the user must
 * enable it as a "searchable item" in the Search settings in order to receive your app's
 * suggestions in Quick Search Box. You should consider how to message this to users of your app -
 * perhaps with a note to the user the first time they launch the app about how to enable search
 * suggestions. This gives your app a chance to be queried for suggestions as the user types into
 * Quick Search Box, though exactly how or if your suggestions will be surfaced is decided by Quick
 * Search Box.
 *
 * <p><b>Source Ranking:</b>  Once your application's search results are made available to Quick
 * Search Box, how they surface to the user for a particular query will be determined as appropriate
 * by Quick Search Box ranking. This may depend on how many other apps have results for that query,
 * and how often the user has clicked on your results compared to the other apps - but there is no
 * guarantee about how ranking will occur, or whether your app's suggestions will show at all for
 * a given query.  In general, you can expect that providing quality results will increase the
 * likelihood that your app's suggestions are provided in a prominent position, and apps that
 * provide lower quality suggestions will be more likely to be ranked lower and/or not displayed.
 *
 * <p><b>Search Settings:</b>  Each app that is available to Quick Search Box has an entry in the
 * system settings where the user can enable or disable the inclusion of its results.  Below the
 * name of the application, each application may provide a brief description of what kind of
 * information will be made available via a search settings description string pointed to by the
 * android:searchSettingsDescription attribute in the searchable metadata. Note that the
 * user will need to visit this settings menu to enable search suggestions for your app before your
 * app will have a chance to provide search suggestions to Quick Search Box - see the section
 * called "Important Note" above.
 *
 * <p><b>Shortcuts:</b>  Suggestions that are clicked on by the user may be automatically made into
 * shortcuts, which are suggestions that have been copied from your provider in order to be quickly
 * displayed without the need to re-query the original sources. Shortcutted suggestions may be
 * displayed for the query that yielded the suggestion and for any prefixes of that query. You can
 * request how to have your app's suggestions made into shortcuts, and whether they should be
 * refreshed, using the {@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_SHORTCUT_ID} column:
 * <ul><li>Suggestions that do not include a shortcut id column will be made into shortcuts and
 * never refreshed.  This makes sense for suggestions that refer to data that will never be changed
 * or removed.</li>
 * <li>Suggestions that include a shortcut id will be re-queried for a fresh version of the
 * suggestion each time the shortcut is displayed.  The shortcut will be quickly displayed with
 * whatever data was most recently available until the refresh query returns, after which the
 * suggestion will be dynamically refreshed with the up to date information.  The shortcut refresh
 * query will be sent to your suggestion provider with a uri of {@link #SUGGEST_URI_PATH_SHORTCUT}.
 * The result should contain one suggestion using the same columns as the suggestion query, or be
 * empty, indicating that the shortcut is no longer valid.  Shortcut ids make sense when referring
 * to data that may change over time, such as a contact's presence status.  If a suggestion refers
 * to data that could take longer to refresh, such as a network based refresh of a stock quote, you
 * may include {@link #SUGGEST_COLUMN_SPINNER_WHILE_REFRESHING} to show a progress spinner for the
 * right hand icon until the refresh is complete.</li>
 * <li>Finally, to prevent a suggestion from being copied into a shortcut, you may provide a
 * shortcut id with a value of {@link #SUGGEST_NEVER_MAKE_SHORTCUT}.</li></ul>
 * 
 * Note that Quick Search Box will ultimately decide whether to shortcut your app's suggestions,
 * considering these values as a strong request from your application.
 * 
 * <a name="ActionKeys"></a>
 * <h3>Action Keys</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Searchable activities may also wish to provide shortcuts based on the various action keys
 * available on the device.  The most basic example of this is the contacts app, which enables the
 * green "dial" key for quick access during searching.  Not all action keys are available on 
 * every device, and not all are allowed to be overriden in this way.  (For example, the "Home"
 * key must always return to the home screen, with no exceptions.)
 * 
 * <p>In order to define action keys for your searchable application, you must do two things.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>You'll add one or more <i>actionkey</i> elements to your searchable metadata configuration
 * file.  Each element defines one of the keycodes you are interested in, 
 * defines the conditions under which they are sent, and provides details
 * on how to communicate the action key event back to your searchable activity.</li>
 * <li>In your broadcast receiver, if you wish, you can check for action keys by checking the 
 * extras field of the {@link android.content.Intent Intent}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Updating metadata.</b>  For each keycode of interest, you must add an &lt;actionkey&gt;
 * element.  Within this element you must define two or three attributes.  The first attribute,
 * &lt;android:keycode&gt;, is required;  It is the key code of the action key event, as defined in 
 * {@link android.view.KeyEvent}.  The remaining two attributes define the value of the actionkey's
 * <i>message</i>, which will be passed to your searchable activity in the 
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent} (see below for more details).  Although each of these 
 * attributes is optional, you must define one or both for the action key to have any effect.
 * &lt;android:queryActionMsg&gt; provides the message that will be sent if the action key is 
 * pressed while the user is simply entering query text.  &lt;android:suggestActionMsgColumn&gt;
 * is used when action keys are tied to specific suggestions.  This attribute provides the name
 * of a <i>column</i> in your suggestion cursor;  The individual suggestion, in that column,
 * provides the message.  (If the cell is empty or null, that suggestion will not work with that
 * action key.)
 * <p>See the <a href="#SearchabilityMetadata">Searchability Metadata</a> section for more details 
 * and examples.
 * 
 * <p><b>Receiving Action Keys</b>  Intents launched by action keys will be specially marked
 * using a combination of values.  This enables your searchable application to examine the intent,
 * if necessary, and perform special processing.  For example, clicking a suggested contact might
 * simply display them;  Selecting a suggested contact and clicking the dial button might
 * immediately call them.
 * 
 * <p>When a search {@link android.content.Intent Intent} is launched by an action key, two values
 * will be added to the extras field.
 * <ul>
 * <li>To examine the key code, use {@link android.content.Intent#getIntExtra 
 * getIntExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_KEY)}.</li>
 * <li>To examine the message string, use {@link android.content.Intent#getStringExtra 
 * getStringExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_MSG)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <a name="SearchabilityMetadata"></a>
 * <h3>Searchability Metadata</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Every activity that is searchable must provide a small amount of additional information
 * in order to properly configure the search system.  This controls the way that your search
 * is presented to the user, and controls for the various modalities described previously.
 * 
 * <p>If your application is not searchable,
 * then you do not need to provide any search metadata, and you can skip the rest of this section.
 * When this search metadata cannot be found, the search manager will assume that the activity 
 * does not implement search.  (Note: to implement web-based search, you will need to add
 * the android.app.default_searchable metadata to your manifest, as shown below.)
 * 
 * <p>Values you supply in metadata apply only to each local searchable activity.  Each
 * searchable activity can define a completely unique search experience relevant to its own
 * capabilities and user experience requirements, and a single application can even define multiple
 * searchable activities.
 *
 * <p><b>Metadata for searchable activity.</b>  As with your search implementations described 
 * above, you must first identify which of your activities is searchable.  In the 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a> entry for this activity, you must 
 * provide two elements:
 * <ul><li>An intent-filter specifying that you can receive and process the 
 * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} {@link android.content.Intent Intent}.
 * </li>
 * <li>A reference to a small XML file (typically called "searchable.xml") which contains the
 * remaining configuration information for how your application implements search.</li></ul>
 * 
 * <p>Here is a snippet showing the necessary elements in the 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a> entry for your searchable activity.
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *        &lt;!-- Search Activity - searchable --&gt;
 *        &lt;activity android:name="MySearchActivity" 
 *                  android:label="Search"
 *                  android:launchMode="singleTop"&gt;
 *            &lt;intent-filter&gt;
 *                &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.SEARCH" /&gt;
 *                &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
 *            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
 *            &lt;meta-data android:name="android.app.searchable" 
 *                       android:resource="@xml/searchable" /&gt;
 *        &lt;/activity&gt;</pre>
 *
 * <p>Next, you must provide the rest of the searchability configuration in 
 * the small XML file, stored in the ../xml/ folder in your build.  The XML file is a 
 * simple enumeration of the search configuration parameters for searching within this activity,
 * application, or package.  Here is a sample XML file (named searchable.xml, for use with
 * the above manifest) for a query-search activity.
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &lt;searchable xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
 *     android:label="@string/search_label"
 *     android:hint="@string/search_hint" &gt;
 * &lt;/searchable&gt;</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note that all user-visible strings <i>must</i> be provided in the form of "@string" 
 * references.  Hard-coded strings, which cannot be localized, will not work properly in search
 * metadata.
 * 
 * <p>Attributes you can set in search metadata:
 * <table border="2" width="85%" align="center" frame="hsides" rules="rows">

 * 
 * <p><b>Styleable Resources in your Metadata.</b>  It's possible to provide alternate strings
 * for your searchable application, in order to provide localization and/or to better visual 
 * presentation on different device configurations.  Each searchable activity has a single XML 
 * metadata file, but any resource references can be replaced at runtime based on device
 * configuration, language setting, and other system inputs.
 * 
 * <p>A concrete example is the "hint" text you supply using the android:searchHint attribute.
 * In portrait mode you'll have less screen space and may need to provide a shorter string, but
 * in landscape mode you can provide a longer, more descriptive hint.  To do this, you'll need to
 * define two or more strings.xml files, in the following directories:
 * <ul><li>.../res/values-land/strings.xml</li>
 * <li>.../res/values-port/strings.xml</li>
 * <li>.../res/values/strings.xml</li></ul>
 * 
 * <p>For more complete documentation on this capability, see
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/resources-i18n.html#AlternateResources">Resources and 
 * Internationalization: Alternate Resources</a>.
 *
 * <p><b>Metadata for non-searchable activities.</b>  Activities which are part of a searchable
 * application, but don't implement search itself, require a bit of "glue" in order to cause
 * them to invoke search using your searchable activity as their primary context.  If this is not
 * provided, then searches from these activities will use the system default search context.
 * 
 * <p>The simplest way to specify this is to add a <i>search reference</i> element to the
 * application entry in the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a> file.  
 * The value of this reference can be either of:
 * <ul><li>The name of your searchable activity.  
 * It is typically prefixed by '.' to indicate that it's in the same package.</li>
 * <li>A "*" indicates that the system may select a default searchable activity, in which
 * case it will typically select web-based search.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Here is a snippet showing the necessary addition to the manifest entry for your 
 * non-searchable activities.
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *        &lt;application&gt;
 *            &lt;meta-data android:name="android.app.default_searchable"
 *                       android:value=".MySearchActivity" /&gt;
 *            
 *            &lt;!-- followed by activities, providers, etc... --&gt;
 *        &lt;/application&gt;</pre>
 *
 * <p>You can also specify android.app.default_searchable on a per-activity basis, by including
 * the meta-data element (as shown above) in one or more activity sections.  If found, these will
 * override the reference in the application section.  The only reason to configure your application
 * this way would be if you wish to partition it into separate sections with different search 
 * behaviors;  Otherwise this configuration is not recommended.
 * 
 * <p><b>Additional metadata for search suggestions.</b>  If you have defined a content provider
 * to generate search suggestions, you'll need to publish it to the system, and you'll need to 
 * provide a bit of additional XML metadata in order to configure communications with it.
 * 
 * <p>First, in your <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest</a>, you'll add the
 * following lines.
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *        &lt;!-- Content provider for search suggestions --&gt;
 *        &lt;provider android:name="YourSuggestionProviderClass"
 *                android:authorities="your.suggestion.authority" /&gt;</pre>
 *

 * <h3>Passing Search Context</h3>
 * 
 * <p>In order to improve search experience, an application may wish to specify
 * additional data along with the search, such as local history or context.  For
 * example, a maps search would be improved by including the current location.  
 * In order to simplify the structure of your activities, this can be done using 
 * the search manager.
 *
 * <p>Any data can be provided at the time the search is launched, as long as it
 * can be stored in a {@link android.os.Bundle Bundle} object.
 *
 * <p>To pass application data into the Search Manager, you'll need to override
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onSearchRequested onSearchRequested} as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &#64;Override
 * public boolean onSearchRequested() {
 *     Bundle appData = new Bundle();
 *     appData.put...();
 *     appData.put...();
 *     startSearch(null, false, appData, false);
 *     return true;
 * }</pre> 
 *
 * <p>To receive application data from the Search Manager, you'll extract it from
 * the {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH}
 * {@link android.content.Intent Intent} as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * final Bundle appData = queryIntent.getBundleExtra(SearchManager.APP_DATA);
 * if (appData != null) {
 *     appData.get...();
 *     appData.get...();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <a name="ProtectingUserPrivacy"></a>
 * <h3>Protecting User Privacy</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Many users consider their activities on the phone, including searches, to be private 
 * information.  Applications that implement search should take steps to protect users' privacy
 * wherever possible.  This section covers two areas of concern, but you should consider your search
 * design carefully and take any additional steps necessary.
 * 
 * <p><b>Don't send personal information to servers, and if you do, don't log it.</b>
 * "Personal information" is information that can personally identify your users, such as name, 
 * email address or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such 
 * information.  If your application implements search with the assistance of a server, try to 
 * avoid sending personal information with your searches.  For example, if you are searching for 
 * businesses near a zip code, you don't need to send the user ID as well - just send the zip code
 * to the server.  If you do need to send personal information, you should take steps to avoid 
 * logging it.  If you must log it, you should protect that data very carefully, and erase it as 
 * soon as possible.
 * 
 * <p><b>Provide the user with a way to clear their search history.</b>  The Search Manager helps
 * your application provide context-specific suggestions.  Sometimes these suggestions are based
 * on previous searches, or other actions taken by the user in an earlier session.  A user may not
 * wish for previous searches to be revealed to other users, for instance if they share their phone
 * with a friend.  If your application provides suggestions that can reveal previous activities,
 * you should implement a "Clear History" menu, preference, or button.  If you are using 
 * {@link android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions}, you can simply call its 
 * {@link android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions#clearHistory() clearHistory()} method from
 * your "Clear History" UI.  If you are implementing your own form of recent suggestions, you'll 
 * need to provide a similar a "clear history" API in your provider, and call it from your
 * "Clear History" UI.
