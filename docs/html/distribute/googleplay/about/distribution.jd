<p>Deliver your apps to the users you want, on the devices you want, on <em>your</em> schedule. </p>

<h2 id="instant">Instant publishing, instant updates</h2>

<p>On Google Play, you can publish your products to customers instantly. Just
upload and configure your product in the <span style="font-weight:500;">Google Play Developer Console</span>
and press the Publish button&mdash;your app appears in the store listings within
hours, not weeks.</p>

<p>Once your app is published, you can update it as often as you want. You can
change prices, configuration, and distribution options at any time through the
Google Play Developer Console, without needing to update your app
binary.</p>

<p>Later, as you add features or address code issues, you can publish an updated
binary at any time. Google Play makes the new version available immediately and
notifies existing customers that an update is ready for download. To streamline
the rollout across your customer base, Google Play also lets users accept
automatic updates of your app, so that your updates are delivered and installed
as soon as you publish them.</p>

<h2 id="targeting">Reaching the customers you want</h2>

<p>Google Play does more than connect your app with users&mdash;it helps you
reach the broadest possible distribution across the Android ecosystem, while
making sure that your app is only available to the audience that you want to
reach.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="geotargeting">Geographic targeting</h3>

<p>You can use controls in the Google Play Developer Console to easily
manage the geographic distribution of your apps, without any changes in your
application binary. You can specify which countries and territories you want to
distribute to, and even which carriers (for some countries). </p>

<p>When users visit the store, Google Play makes sure that they are in one of
your targeted countries before downloading your app. You can change your country
and carrier targeting at any time just by saving changes in the Google Play
Developer Console.</p>

<p>To help you market to users around the world, you
can <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/publish/preparing.html#localize">localize
your store listing</a>, including app details and description,
promotional graphics, screenshots, and more.</p>

<div style="float:right;margin-left:18px;border:1px solid #DDD;margin:1.5em;">

style="width:400px;padding:4px;margin-bottom:0;">
</div>

<h3 id="captargeting">Capabilities targeting</h3>

<p>Google Play also lets you control distribution according to device features
or capabilities that your app depends on. There are several types of
dependencies that the app can define in its manifest, such as hardware features,
OpenGL texture compression formats, libraries, Android platform versions, and
others.</p>

<p>When you upload your app, Google Play reads the dependencies and sets up any
necessary distribution rules. For technical information about declaring
dependencies, read <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/filters.html">Filters on 
Google Play</a>. </p>

<p>For pinpoint control over distribution, Google Play lets you see all of the
devices your app is available to based on its dependencies (if any). From the
Google Play Developer Console, you can list the supported devices and
even exclude specific devices if needed.</p>

<h2 id="stats">Statistics for analyzing installs</h2>

<p>Once you’ve published your app, Google Play makes it easy to see how it’s
doing. The Google Play Developer Console gives you access to a variety
of anonymized metrics that show your app’s installation performance measured by
unique users and unique devices, across a variety of different dimensions such
as country, Android version, device, country, carrier, and app version.</p>

<div style="border:1px solid #DDD;margin:1.5em;margin-left:8%;width:608px">
<img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-dc-stats-mini.png"
style="width:600px;padding:4px;margin-bottom:0;">
</div>
<p>You can also view your installation data on timeline charts, for all metrics and
dimensions. At a glance, these charts highlight your app’s installation peaks
and longer-term trends, which you can correlate to promotions, app improvements,
or other factors. You can even focus in on data inside a dimension by
highlighting specific data points (such as individual platform versions or
languages) on the timeline.</p>

<p>So that you can “take your data with you”, you can download all of your
installation data as a CSV file for viewing in the business program of your
choice.</p>


<h2 id="advanced">Advanced delivery options</h2>

<p>Google Play offers convenient options for managing how your apps are
delivered to users.</p>

<p>In most cases, it’s easy to create an app that supports all of your targeted
screen sizes and platform versions from a single APK. Distributing a single APK
to all of your users is a highly recommended approach, because it’s the easiest
way to manage and maintain the app. If you need to deliver a different APK to
devices, Google Play provides a way to do that. </p>
 
<p>An option called Multiple APK support lets you create multiple APK packages
that use the same package name but differ in their OpenGL texture compression
formats, screen-size support, or Android platform versions supported. You can
upload all of the APKs to Google Play under a single product listing and Google
Play selects the best APK to deliver to users, based on the characteristics of
their devices.  </p>

<p>The APK Expansion Files option lets you upload up to two secondary downloads
for each published APK, including multiple APKs. Each of the two expansion files
can be up to 2GB each and can contain any type of code or assets. When you
upload the expansion files, Google Play hosts them for free and handles the
download of the files as part of the normal APK installation.</p>

<h2 id="licensing">Protecting your App</h2>

<p>To help you protect your application against piracy, Google Play offers a
licensing service that you can implement in your app. It’s a network-based
service that lets an application query a trusted Google Play licensing server to
determine whether the application is licensed to the current device user.</p>
