<dt>description:</dt>
<dd>Lets you specify the screen dimensions the
application supports.  By default a modern application (using API Level 4 or higher) supports all
screen sizes and must explicitly disable certain screen sizes here;
older applications are assumed to support only the "normal"
screen size.  Note that screen size is a separate axis from
density. Screen size is determined as the available pixels to an application
after density scaling has been applied. 

<p>Based on the target device screen density, the Android 
framework will scale down assets by a factor of 0.75 (low dpi screens) 
or scale them up by a factor of 1.5 (high dpi screens).
The screen density is expressed as dots-per-inch (dpi).</p>

<dl class="attr"><dt><a name="small"></a>{@code android:smallScreens}</dt>
  <dd>Indicates whether the application supports smaller screen form-factors.
     A small screen is defined as one with a smaller aspect ratio than
     the "normal" (traditional HVGA) screen.  An application that does
     not support small screens <em>will not be available</em> for
     small screen devices, because there is little the platform can do
     to make such an application work on a smaller screen. Applications using
     API Level 4 or higher default this to "true", others are "false".
  </dd>
  
  <dt><a name="normal"></a>{@code android:normalScreens}</dt>
  <dd>Indicates whether an application supports the "normal" screen
     form-factors.  Traditionally this is an HVGA medium density
     screen, but WQVGA low density and WVGA high density are also
     considered to be normal.  This attribute is "true" by default,
     and applications currently should leave it that way.
  </dd>
  
  <dt><a name="large"></a>{@code android:largeScreens}</dt>
  <dd>Indicates whether the application supports larger screen form-factors.
     A large screen is defined as a screen that is significantly larger
     than a "normal" phone screen, and thus may require some special care
     on the application's part to make good use of it. An application that 
     does not support large screens will be placed as a "postage stamp" on 
     such a screen, so that it retains the dimensions it was originally
     designed for. Applications using API Level 4 or higher default 
     to "true", others are "false".
  </dd>
  
  <dt><a name="any"></a>{@code android:anyDensity}</dt>
  <dd>Indicates whether the application can accommodate any screen
     density.  Older applications (pre API Level 4) are assumed unable to
     accomodate all densities and this is "false" by default. Applications using 
     API Level 4 or higher are assumed able to and this is "true" by default. 
     You can explicitly supply your abilities here.
