computer.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
If you're developing on Mac OS X or Linux, then you do not need to install a
USB driver. Refer to <a

<p>The sections below provide instructions on how to download the USB Driver
for Windows and install it on your development computer. </p>

<h3>Downloading the USB Driver for Windows</h3>

<p>The USB Driver for Windows is available for download as an optional SDK
component. You need the driver only if you are developing on Windows and 
want to connect an Android-powered device to your development environment
over USB. </p>

<p>To install the driver or upgrade your existing driver to the latest
revision, you must first download the driver to your development computer. </p>

<p>To download the driver, use the Android SDK and AVD Manager tool that is
included with the Android SDK. If you haven't yet installed the Android SDK, as
described in <a href="installing.html">Installing the Android SDK</a>, please do
so before continuing with the driver installation. </p>

<p>When you are ready to download the driver, follow the instructions given in
<a href="adding-components.html">Adding SDK Components</a> to launch the Android
SDK and AVD Manager. From the <strong>Available Packages</strong> panel, select
"Usb Driver Package" and download it to your computer. The driver files are
downloaded into the <code>&lt;sdk&gt;\usb_driver</code> directory.</p>

<p>After the download, follow the instructions below to install or upgrade the
driver, based on your needs and Windows operating system version. If you are
connecting an Android-powered device to your computer for the first time, follow
the below procedure to "Perform a fresh installation." If you have installed one
of the older USB drivers and would like to upgrade to the latest version, follow
the procedure to "Upgrade an existing driver."</p>

<p>Once you've completed the USB driver installation,
please see <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/device.html">Developing on a Device</a> for
other important information about using an Android-powered device for
development.</p>
