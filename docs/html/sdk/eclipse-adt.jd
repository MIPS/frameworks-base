<p>Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE 
that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which
to build Android applications. </p>

<p>ADT extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android
projects, create an application UI, add components based on the Android
Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even
export signed (or unsigned) APKs in order to distribute your application.</p>

<p>Developing in Eclipse with ADT is highly recommended and is the fastest way
to get started. With the guided project setup it provides, as well as tools
integration, custom XML editors, and debug ouput pane, ADT gives you an
incredible boost in developing Android applications. </p>

<p>This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to download the ADT
plugin and install it into your Eclipse development environment. Note that
before you can install or use ADT, you must have compatible versions of both the
Eclipse IDE and the Android SDK installed. For details, make sure to read <a
href="#installing">Installing the ADT Plugin</a>, below. </p>

<p>If you are already using ADT, this document also provides instructions on 
how to update ADT to the latest version or how to uninstall it, if necessary.
</p>

<h2 id="notes">Revisions</h2>

<p>The sections below provide notes about successive releases of
the ADT Plugin, as denoted by revision number. </p>

<h2 id="installing">Installing the ADT Plugin</h2>

<p>The sections below provide instructions on how to download and install
ADT into your Eclipse environment. If you encounter problems, see the <a
href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="preparing">Preparing Your Development Computer</h3>

<p>ADT is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE. Before you can install or use ADT,
you must have a compatible version of Eclipse installed on your development
computer. </p>

<ul>
<li>If Eclipse is already installed on your computer, make sure that it is
a version that is compatible with ADT and the Android SDK. Check the <a
href="requirements.html">System Requirements</a> document for
a list of Eclipse versions that are compatible with the Android SDK.</li>
<li>If you need to install or update Eclipse, you can download it from this
location:

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><a href=
"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>
</p>

<p>A Java or RCP version of Eclipse is recommended.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, before you can configure or use ADT, you must install the
Android SDK starter package, as described in <a
href="installing.html#Installing">Downloading the SDK Starter Pacskage</a>.
Specifically, you need to install a compatible version of the Android SDK Tools
and at least one development platform. To simplify ADT setup, we recommend
installing the Android SDK prior to installing ADT. </p>

<p>When your Eclipse and Android SDK environments are ready, continue with the
ADT installation as described in the steps below. </p>

<h3 id="downloading">Downloading the ADT Plugin</h3>

<p>Use Update Manager feature of your Eclipse installation to install the latest
revision of ADT on your development computer.<p>

<p>Assuming that you have a compatible version of the Eclipse IDE installed, as
described in <a href="#preparing">Preparing for Installation</a>, above, follow
these steps to download the ADT plugin and install it in your Eclipse
environment. </p>

</td>

</table>

<h3 id="preparing">Configuring the ADT Plugin</h3>

<p>Once you've successfully downnloaded ADT as described above, the next step
is to modify your ADT preferences in Eclipse to point to the Android SDK directory:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences...</strong> to open the Preferences
        panel (Mac OS X: <strong>Eclipse</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>).</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Android</strong> from the left panel. </li>
    <li>For the <em>SDK Location</em> in the main panel, click <strong>Browse...</strong> and 
        locate your downloaded SDK directory. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Done! If you haven't encountered any problems, then the installation is
complete. Now read <a href="installing.html#components">Adding Platforms and
Other Components</a> for instructions on how to complete the setup of your 
SDK environment. </p>


<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting ADT Installation</h3>

<p> If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the
steps above, here are some suggestions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>If Eclipse can not find the remote update site containing the ADT plugin,
try changing the remote site URL to use http, rather than https. That is, set
the Location for the remote site to:
<pre>http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre></li> 
<li>If you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make sure that
you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse. In Eclipse 3.3/3.4,
you can configure proxy information from the main Eclipse menu in
<strong>Window</strong> (on Mac OS X, <strong>Eclipse</strong>) &gt;
<strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Network
Connections</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p> If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a
remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local machine and
manually install it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the current ADT Plugin zip file from the table below (do not unpack it).

  <table class="download">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Package</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>MD5 Checksum</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ADT {@adtZipVersion}</td>
    <td>
      <a href="http://dl.google.com/android/{@adtZipDownload}">{@adtZipDownload}</a>
    </td>
    <td>{@adtZipBytes} bytes</td>
    <td>{@adtZipChecksum}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</li>

</li>
  <li>Follow steps 1 and 2 in the <a href="#installing">default install 
      instructions</a> (above).</li>
  <li>In the Add Site dialog, click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>
  <li>Browse and select the downloaded zip file.</li>
  <li>In Eclipse 3.5 only, enter a name for the local update site (e.g.,
      "Android Plugin") in the "Name" field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.
  <li>Follow the remaining procedures as listed for 
      <a href="#installing">default installation</a> above,
      starting from step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>To update your plugin once you've installed using the zip file, you will have
to follow these steps again instead of the default update instructions.</p>

<h4>Other install errors</h4>

<p>Note that there are features of ADT that require some optional 
Eclipse components (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when 
installing ADT, your Eclipse installion might not include these components. 
For information about how to quickly add the necessary components to your 
Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic 
<a href="{@docRoot}resources/faq/troubleshooting.html#installeclipsecomponents">ADT 
Installation Error: "requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui"</a>.</p>

<h4>For Linux users</h4>
<p>If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse: 
<pre>
An error occurred during provisioning.
Cannot connect to keystore.
JKS</pre>
<p>
...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing Sun
Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT
Plugin.</p>


<h2 id="updating">Updating the ADT Plugin</h2>

<p>From time to time, a new revision of the ADT Plugin becomes available, with
new features and bug fixes. Generally, when a new revision of ADT is available,
you should update to it as soon as convenient. </p>

<p>In some cases, a new revision of ADT will have a dependency on a specific
revision of the Android SDK Tools. If such dependencies exist, you will need to
update the SDK Tools component of the SDK after installing the new revision of
ADT. To update the SDK Tools component, use the Android SDK and AVD Manager, as
described in <a href="adding-components.html">Adding SDK Components</a>.</p>

<p>To learn about new features of each ADT revision and also any dependencies on
the SDK Tools, see the listings in the <a href="#notes">Revisions</a>
section. To determine the version currently installed, open the 
Eclipse Installed Software window using <strong>Help</strong>
&gt; <strong>Software Updates</strong> and refer to the version listed for 
"Android Development Tools".</p>

<p>Follow the steps below to check whether an update is available and, if so, 
to install it. </p>
